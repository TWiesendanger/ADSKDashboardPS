# ADSKDashboard

Shortcuts to open Autodesk Software.

If you have multiple Autodeskproducts in diffrent releases and languages installade it can be a pain to open exactly what you need. At least thats what I was experiencing and so I built this tool.

Currently it works for AutoCAD / AutoCAD Mechanical / Inventor / Inventor Read Only from Release 2017 to 2021.

# What is installed?

At startup it will check what is installed and depending on that it will display a Icon or not.

So as a sample if click on 2020 there are alot more products displayed because there is also AutoCAD and AutoCAD Mechanical installed.

# Settings

At the moment there are only three settings. you can change to a dark mode and you can set the window to be always on top.
Also you can decide if the window should be minimized after clicking on something to start.

# Closing

If you hover over the "X" in the top right corner, you can see that it tells you close to systray. It wont actualy close from there.

After that you can restart it from systray.

or close it.

![exit](/docs/adskd_exit.png)

# Tool doesn't start

At the moment it is not signed so you probably get a windows defender message which you need to allow.

Also make sure that all dll files are not blocked. Open res\assembly folder and check by rightclicking on dll file.
